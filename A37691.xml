            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the expreſſions of your Majeſties Meſſage, the ſecond of this inſtant Moneth, do give juſt cauſe of ſorrow to Us your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties faithfull Subjects, the Lords and Commons in Parliament; yet it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome mixture of Confidence and Hope, conſidering they proceed from the Miſapprehenſions of our Actions &amp; Intentions, which having no ground of truth or reality, may, by your Majeſties Iuſtice and Wiſedome be removed, when your Majeſty ſhall be fully informed, that theſe fears and jealouſies of Ours, which your Majeſty thinkes to bee cauſeleſſe, and without juſt grounds, doe neceſſarily and clearely ariſe from theſe dangers and diſtempers, into which the miſchievous and evill Counſellours about you have brought this Kingdome: and that thoſe other feares and jealouſies by which your favour, your Royal preſence and Confidence have been withdrawne from your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have no foundation or ſubſiſtence in any Action, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or Miſcarriage of Ours, but are meerly grounded upon the falſhood and malice of thoſe, who for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and fomenting their own wicked deſignes againſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110740:3"/>the Religion and Peace of this kingdome, doe ſeeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive your Majeſty of the ſtrength and affection of your People, them of your Grace and protection; and thereby to ſubject both your Royall perſon and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to ruine and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>To ſatisfie your Majeſties Judgement and Conſcience in both theſe points, We deſire to make a cleare and free Declaration, of the Cauſes of our feares and jealouſies, which We offer to your Majeſty in thoſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the deſigne of Altering Religion, in this, and in your other Kingdomes, hath beene potently carryed on by thoſe in greateſt Authority about you, for divers yeares together; and that the Queeens Agent at Rome, and the Popes Agent at <hi>Nuncio</hi> here, are not only evidences of this deſigne, but have been great Actors in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Warres with Scotland was procured to make way for this Intention, and chiefly incited and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the papiſts, and others Popiſhly affected, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have many evidences, eſpecially their free and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Contribution to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Rebellion in Ireland was framed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived here in England: and that the Engliſh Papiſts ſhould have riſen about the ſame time, We have divers teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Advertiſements from Ireland: and that it is a common ſpeech among the Rebells, wherewith concurre other Evidences and obſervations of the ſuſpitious Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Conſultations: the tumultuary and ſeditious carriage of thoſe of that Religion, in divers parts of the Kingdome, about the breaking out of the Iriſh Rebellion: the Depoſition of <hi>O Conneli:</hi> the Information of Mr <hi>Cole</hi> Miniſter: the Letter of <hi>Preſtram Whitcomb,</hi> the Depoſition of <hi>Thomas Crant:</hi> and many others, which we may produce doe all agree in this.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:110740:3"/>
            <p n="4">4. The publicke Declaration of the Lords, Gentlemen and others of the Pale, that they would joyn with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, whom they call the Iriſh Army, or any other, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto his Majeſty his Royall Perogative, wreſted from him by the Puritan Faction in the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in England; and to maintaine the ſame againſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as alſo to maintaine Epiſcopall juriſdiction, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe thereof; theſe two being the Quarrells upon which his Majeſties late Army in the North ſhould have been incenſed againſt us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The great Cauſe we have no doubt, that the late deſigne, ſtyled The Queens pious Intention, was for the Alteration of Religion in this Kingdome: for ſucceſſe whereof the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and <hi>Count Roſetti</hi> injoyned Faſting and Praying to be obſerved every week, by the Engliſh Papiſts, which appeared to Us by one of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Letters directed by him to a prieſt in Lancaſhire.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The boldnes of the Rebels in affirming <hi>They do nothing but by Authority from the King,</hi> that they cal themſelves the Queenes Army; that the Prey or Boory which they take from the Engliſh, they marke with the Queens Marke. That their purpoſe was to come into England, after they had done in Ireland: and ſundry other things of this kinde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>O Conneli,</hi> and divers others; eſpecially the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Letter from <hi>Treſtram Whitecombe</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of Kinſaile to his Brother <hi>Benjamin Whitecomb,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is this paſſage, that <hi>Many other ſpeeches they utter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, and our Court of England, which hee dares not commit to paper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manifold Attempts to provoke your Majeſties late Army, and the Army of the Scots, and to raiſe a Faction in the City of London and other parts of the Kingdome: that thoſe who have been Actors in this buſines, have had their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110740:4"/>Dependance, Countenance and Incouragement from the Court, witneſſe the Treaſon wherof Mr <hi>Germin</hi> and others ſtand accuſed, who were tranſported beyond Sea by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant under your Majeſties hand, after your Majeſtie had given Aſſurance to your Parliament that your Majeſty had layd a ſtrick command upon all your Servants, that none of them ſhould depart from Court; and that dangerous Petition delivered to Captaine <hi>Legge</hi> by your Majeſties owne hand, accompanied with a Direction figned with <hi>C. R.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The falſe and ſcandalous Accuſation againſt the Lord <hi>Kymbolton,</hi> and the Five Members of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, tendred to the Parliament, by your Majeſties owne Command, endeavouring to bee juſtified in the City by your own preſence and perſwaſion; and to bee put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution upon their Perſons, by your Majeſties demand of them in the Houſe of Commons, in ſo terrible and violent a manner, as farre exceeded all former breaches of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament, acted by your Majeſty, or any of your Predeceſſors: And what ſoever your own Intentions were, divers bloudy and deſperate perſons, which attended your Majeſty, diſcovered their affections and reſolutions to have maſſacred and deſtroyed the Members of that Houſe; if the abſence of thoſe Perſons accuſed, had not by Gods providence ſtopt the giving of that word which they expected, for the ſetting them upon that barbarous and bloudy deſigne.</p>
            <p>The Liſting of ſo many Officers, Souldiers and others, putting them into pay, and under Command of Colonells, keeping them at White Hall, Feaffing and catouſing them in an unuſuall manner, thereby maintaining them in the violent Aſſaults, and other injuries, which they offered to divers of your Subjects, comming that way in a Lawfull
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110740:4"/>and peaceable manner, the carrying them out of the town, and keeping them in ſo long a pay, after which they were told by the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> that <hi>the King removed on purpoſe they might not betrampled in the durt;</hi> and indeavouring to ingage the Gentlemen of the Innes of Court in the ſame courſe, the plotting and deſigning of a perpetuall Guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your Majeſty, the labouring to infuſe into your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subjects an evill opinion of the Parliament through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Kingdome, and other ſymptomes of a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of raiſing Armes, and dividing your people by a Civil Warre, in which combuſtion, Ireland muſt needes be loſt, and this Realme miſerably waſted and conſumed, if not wholly ruined and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Lord</hi> Digby <hi>ſhould preſume to counſell your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to declare your ſelf, and to retire to a place of ſtrength in this Kingdome, and to perſwade you that you could not bee ſafe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your People, and yet ſhould have ſuch credit with you as to bee ſent away by your warrant to Sir</hi> John Pennington, <hi>to land him beyond the Sea, where he took that tranſcendent bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to vent his own trayterous conceptions in the Letter to the Queen,</hi> offering to entertaine a correſpondencie with her Majeſty by Cyphers, intimating ſome ſervice which hee might do in thoſe parts: for which he deſired your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Inſtructions, whereby in all probability hee intended the procureing of ſome forreigne forces to ſtrengthen your Majeſty in that condition to which hee would have brought: which falſe and malicious counſell and advice, we have great cauſe to doubt, made too deep an impreſſion in your Majeſty, conſidering the courſe you are now plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take, of abſenting your ſelfe from your Parliament, and carrying the Prince with you, which ſeemes to expreſſe a purpoſe in your Majeſty to keep your ſelfe in a readineſſe for the acting of it.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:110740:5"/>
            <p>The manifold advertiſements we have had from Rome, Venice, Paris, and other parts, that they ſtil expect that you have ſome great deſigne in hand, for the altering of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the breaking neck of your Parliament, that you will yet finde meanes to compaſſe that deſigne, that the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> hath ſollicited the Kings of France and Spain, to lend your Majeſty 4000. men apiece, to help to maintaine your Royaltie againſt the Parliament, <hi>and this of forreigne force ſeemeth to be the moſt pernicious and malignant deſigne of all the reſt,</hi> becauſe no man can beleeve you will give up your people and your Kingdome to bee ſpoiled by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, if you did not likewiſe intend both to change your own profeſſion in Religion, and the publicke profeſſion of the Kingdome, that ſo you might ſtill bee more aſſured of thoſe forreigne ſtates of the popiſh Religion for your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſupport and defence: but wee hope God will direct your Majeſty to better counſels.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the grounds of our feares and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, which made us ſo earneſtly to implore your royall Authoritie and Protection for our defence and ſecurity, in all the wayes of humilitie and ſubmiſſion, which being denyed by your Maieſtie, ſeduced by evill Councells, We doe with ſorrow, for the great and inavoydable miſerie, which is like to fall upon your own perſon, and your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, apply ourſelves to the uſe of that Power, for the ſecuritie and defence of both, which by the fundamentall Laws and Conſtitutions of this Kingdome, reſides in Us: Yet ſtill reſolving to keep our ſelves within the bounds of Faithfulneſſe and Allegeance to your ſacred perſon, and your Crownes: ſo as to the Second ſort of jealouſies and feares, of Us expreſt by your Majeſtie, We ſhall give a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but as true and as faithfull an Anſwere.</p>

               <p>THe Lords and Commons have commanded us to preſent unto your Majeſty this further addition to their former Declaration.</p>
               <p>That your Majeſties return and continuance neer the Parliament, is a matter in their apprehenſion, of ſo great neceſſity and importance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the preſervation of your Royall Perſon &amp; your Kingdomes, that they cannot think they have diſcharged their duties in the ſingle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their deſire, unleſs they ad ſome further reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to back it with I. Your Majeſties abſence will cauſe men to beleeve, that it is out of deſigne to diſcourage the undertakers, and hinder the other proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for raiſing money for defence of Ireland.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It will very much hearten the Rebels there, and diſaffected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this Kingdome, as being an evidence, and effect of the jealouſie and diviſion betwixt your Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">III. That it will much weaken and withdraw the affection of the Subject from your Majeſty, without which a Prince is deprived of his chiefeſt ſtrength and luſtre, and left naked in the greateſt dangers and miſeries that can be imagined.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That it will invite and encourage the enemies of our Religion, and the State of Forreigne parts, to the attempting and acting of their evil deſignes and intentions towards us.</p>

               <head>His Majeſties Speech to the Committee, the 9. of March 1642. when they preſented the Declaration of both Houſes of Parliament at New-market.</head>
               <p>I Am confident that you expect not I ſhould give you a ſpeedy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this ſtrange and unexpected Declaration. And I am ſorry (in the diſtraction of this Kingdome) you ſhould think this way of addreſſe to be more convenient, than that purpoſed by my Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the 20. of January laſt to both Houſes.</p>
               <p>As concerning the grounds of your feares and Jealouſies, I will take time to anſwer particularly, and doubt not, but I ſhall do it to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the whole world. God in his good time will I hope diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſecrets of all Plots and Treaſons: and then I ſhall ſtand right in the eyes of all my People. In the mean time, I muſt tell you, that I rather expected a Vindication for the imputation laid on me in Maſter PYMS Speech, than that any more generall rumours and diſcourſes ſhould get credit with you.</p>
               <p>For my feares and doubts, I did not think they ſhould have beene thought ſo groundleſſe or triviall, while ſo many ſeditious pamphlets and Sermons are looked upon, and ſo great tumults are remembred, unpuniſhed, uninquired into: I ſtill confeſſe my feares, and call God to witneſſe, That they are greater for the true Proteſtant Profeſſion, my people and lawes, than for my own Right or ſafety, though I muſt tell you, I conceive that none of theſe are free from danger.</p>
               <p>What would you have? Have I violated your Lawes? Have I deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to paſſe any one Bill for the eaſe and ſecurity of my Subiects? I do not ask you what you have done for me.</p>
               <p>Have any of my people beene tranſport with feares and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? I have offered as free and generall a Pardon, as your ſelves can deviſe. All this conſidered There is a Judgement from Heaven upon this Nation, if theſe diſtractions continue.</p>
               <p>God ſo deal with Me and Mine, as all my thoughts and intentions are upright for the maintenance of the true Proteſtant Profeſſion, and for the obſervation and preſervation of the lawes of this Land: And I hope, God will bleſſe and aſſiſt thoſe lawes for My preſervation.</p>
               <p>As for the Additionall Declaration, you are to expect an anſwer to it, when you ſhall receive the anſwer to the Declaration it ſelf.</p>
